        question: "What are some tips for writing a great cover letter?",
        answer: "The important thing to remember with a cover letter is that it is an opportunity to sell yourself to the company. You want to make sure that you highlight your skills and experience that are most relevant to the position you are applying for - avoid experiences that are not relevant to the role. You also want to avoid sounding like you are repeating your resume. Try to focus on one or two key points that you want to get across. Finally, make sure to proofread your cover letter before you send it!",
